# Traffic Light Navigator App (Concept)

## Description

This project is a conceptual design and initial UI draft for a mobile application (Android & iOS) aimed at providing intelligent navigation by considering real-time and learned traffic light statuses. The core idea is to help users avoid red lights by understanding traffic light timings, which improve over time through crowdsourcing and data analysis. The app will also allow users to report various traffic light aspects, including standard signals, arrows (left, right, U-turn), and pedestrian signals.

**Note:** This repository currently contains the conceptual design and very early UI drafts. Full backend and frontend implementation is a future step.

## Current Status

*   **Overall:** Planning and Design Phase Complete.
*   **Backend:** Detailed conceptual design for database schema and API endpoints is complete. No code implemented yet.
*   **Mobile App (Flutter):**
    *   Initial UI draft for the Login Screen (`lib/screens/login_screen.dart`).
    *   Conceptual design for other screens and features is complete.

## Planned Features

*   **User Authentication:** Email/password and social logins.
*   **Map Display:** Interactive map with current user location.
*   **Traffic Light Mapping:**
    *   Display known traffic lights and their aspects (standard, arrows, U-turn, pedestrian).
    *   Allow users to add new traffic lights and define their aspects.
    *   Allow users to report timings for each specific aspect of a traffic light.
*   **Real-time Status (Prediction):**
    *   Predict current status of traffic light aspects based on learned patterns.
    *   Display predicted status on the map and during navigation.
*   **Intelligent Routing:**
    *   Route optimization that considers predicted traffic light wait times.
    *   Prioritize routes that minimize red light encounters.
*   **Crowdsourcing & Learning:**
    *   System learns and refines traffic light timing patterns over time based on user reports.
    *   User reputation system to improve data quality.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Support for Android and iOS via Flutter.

## Conceptual Backend Architecture

*   **Language/Framework:** (To be decided - e.g., Python with Flask/Django, Node.js with Express)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (for geospatial queries).
*   **Key Data Models:**
    *   `Users`
    *   `TrafficLights` (physical locations/installations)
    *   `TrafficLightAspects` (individual signal components like arrows, standard balls)
    *   `TrafficLightTimings` (user-reported timings per aspect)
    *   `AggregatedAspectPatterns` (learned timing patterns per aspect)
    *   `UserReportedAspectStatus` (real-time observations)
*   **API:** RESTful API for communication between the mobile app and the backend.

## Setup (Generic Flutter Project)

To set up and run this Flutter project (once more code is added):

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Ensure you have Flutter installed.** If not, follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    (This will run the app on a connected device or simulator.)

## How to Contribute

(Details to be added if this becomes an open-source project - e.g., coding standards, pull request process.)

This README provides a good overview for anyone visiting your repository. You can expand on each section as the project develops.

What would you like to do next? For instance, we could:
1.  Create the `main.dart` file and set up basic navigation to show the `LoginScreen`.
2.  Start drafting the SQL for the next database table (e.g., `TrafficLights`).
3.  Discuss state management for the Flutter login screen.
